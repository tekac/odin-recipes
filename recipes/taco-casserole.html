    <ul>
      1 Cup Chopped Onion
    </ul>
    <ul>
      1/2 Cup Water
    </ul>
    <ul>
      1 package Taco Seasoning Mix
    </ul>
    <ul>
      1 Can Refried Beans
    </ul>
    <ul>
      1/2 Cup Salsa
    </ul>
    <ul>
      1 Can Sliced Black Olives
    </ul>
    <ul>
      1 can Diced Green chilies
    </ul>
    <ul>
      15 Taco Shells
    </ul>
    <ul>
      2 Cups shredded Cheddar cheese
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Spray a 9x13-inch baking
      pan with cooking spray.
    </ol>
    <ol>
      Cook ground beef and onions in a skillet over medium heat until beef is
      browned, 7 to 10 minutes; drain grease. Stir in water and taco seasoning;
      cook, stirring often, until thickened, about 2 minutes. Add refried beans,
      salsa, olives, and green chiles. Cook and stir over low heat until
      ingredients are warmed through, 3 to 4 minutes.
    </ol>
    <ol>
      Place half of the taco shells in the bottom of the baking dish. Pour in
      half of the ground beef mixture; sprinkle with half of the Cheddar cheese.
      Repeat with remaining taco shells, ground beef mixture, and Cheddar
      cheese.
    </ol>
    <ol>
      Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and bubbly, 20 to 25
      minutes.
